> Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

And it really was that easy.
The site was set up using [Jonathan McGlone's excellent tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) with a sprinking of design provided by [Jeremy Thomas's Web Design in 4 minutes](http://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes)

To get started check out the [website project]({{ site.baseurl }}/project/website)
