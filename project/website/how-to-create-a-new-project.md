__Tip:__  _Hold Ctrl or &#8984; button when clicking a link to open it in a new tab_ 
{: .touch-hidden}

1. If you do not have one, [create a new account](https://github.com/join) on GitHub (choose the free plan and do not worry about creating a project at the end, but do verify your email address).
2. Find the [Bradford CoderDojo](https://github.com/bradford-coderdojo/bradford-coderdojo.github.io) repository in GitHub
3. Clone the repository  
![Picture showing where the clone button is in GitHub]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/website/instructions-clone.jpg "Clone example")  
4. Choose "Open in Desktop"
5. If you don't have GitHub desktop - download and install it now.  Log in, go to the dashboard and then go back to 2
6. If you do have GitHub desktop but it just keeps opening the download page - make sure you are signed into the GitHub website.
7. Choose a sensible place to clone the repository on your local machine.
8. Open the repository in explorer - by default on windows this will take you to documents\GitHub\bradford-coderdojo.github.io
9. Open the project folder
10. Open the index.md file in an editor of your choice (notepad will do on windows)
11. The file is in a language called MarkDown (as are these instructions) - [This cheatsheet will help you](https://en.support.wordpress.com/markdown-quick-reference/)  
12. Create a new entry in the index.md file as follows  

    ~~~~~
    [The name of your new project](/project/my-project-name)
    ~~~~~
Changing the name of 'my-project-name' to what ever you want to call your project
13. Create a new folder to store you project files in under the project folder - make sure the name is the same as what your called it in the line you have just entered in instruction 12  
    ![Picture showing where to create a new folder in windows]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/website/instructions-new-folder.jpg "New folder example")
14. Create a new file in this folder called 'index.md' and populate it with the following (change the date, title and put whatever you want in)  
    __Tip:__ When creating the file make sure that windows explorer isn't hiding the file extension other wise you can't easily change it from a txt document.  You can change it like this:

    #Is the turnip underrated?
    They are clearly inedible.  Why do people insist on cooking them?

    Here are [some great turnip recipes](http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/turnip) to get us started
